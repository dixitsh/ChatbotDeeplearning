# ChotbotDeeplearning
About the project
We are going to develop a chatbot that can answer the queries the user put in front of it. For developing it, we are going to use the python library chatterbot. The interaction between the bot and the user is on the command prompt or terminal. The conversation is done through a series of questions and its response in the form of textual form.

What Is a Chatbot?
A chatbot also known as a chatterbot, bot, artificial agent, etc is basically software program driven by artificial intelligence which serves the purpose of making a conversation with the user by texts or by speech. Famous examples include Siri, Alexa, etc.

These chatbots are inclined towards performing a specific task for the user. Chatbots often perform tasks like making a transaction, booking a hotel, form submissions, etc.






 
An untrained instance of ChatterBot starts off with no knowledge of how to communicate. Each time a user enters a statement, the library saves the text that they entered and the text that the statement was in response to. As ChatterBot receives more input the number of responses that it can reply and the accuracy of each response in relation to the input statement increase.

The program selects the closest matching response by searching for the closest matching known statement that matches the input, it then chooses a response from the selection of known responses to that statement.
